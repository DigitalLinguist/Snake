# Introduction
After going through a period of feeling disillusioned and burned out, I wanted 
to code something quick, simple, and fun.

Looking for something small-scale, which didn't involve setting up lots of 
additional frameworks, database connections, or such, I settled on building a 
basic game in Python.

## Why Make This?
Although Python is one of the languages with which I have the most experience, 
I have not previously made any games with it - so it was both familiar and new, 
which was refreshing.

Coding this was also a fun little reminder of the usefulness of lambda 
functions.

## Opportunities for Further Development [as of 4 Feb 2022]
- **Resolve the reset bug:** There's a small bug in the program right now - upon
  resetting the window post-collision, the refresh frame rate decreases 
  exponentially with each subsequent reset.
- **Adding 2-player mode:** Another potential avenue to develop the game would 
  be to extend it by enabling two people to play against each other, or at the 
  same time.

### Credits
This was made following the LinkedIn Learning course, 'Building the Classic Snake Game with Python'.
